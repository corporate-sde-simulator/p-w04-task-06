# Meeting Notes - Sprint 26 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Kavitha Rajan (Lead), Kiran, Intern

---

## Circuit breaker with exponential backoff

- **Kavitha Rajan:** This is blocking our release. Kiran started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Kiran:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `circuitBreaker.ts` and `backoffStrategy.ts`
- [ ] @Kiran - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Kavitha Rajan - Final sign-off before merge
